## Note on art
The cute catboys I use as terminal backgrounds are drawn by talented artists on DeviantArt or Pixiv.
Based on DeviantArt's [copyright policy](https://www.deviantart.com/about/policy/copyright/), it would be
copyright infringement for be to upload them to this repo, especially since I had to edit some to make them
have a dark theme. Plus, putting cringe copyright aside, the artists may not want my god-awful edits uploaded
here.

Instead, currently these artworks are kept in a separate, private repo for personal use only so as not to
violate copyright. However, the artwork I used is linked below, so you can recreate it yourself if you'd like.
